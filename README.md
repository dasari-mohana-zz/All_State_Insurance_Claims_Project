# All_State_Insurance_Claims_Project

# Objective: 
We will predict how severe insurance claims will be for All State. We accomplish this using ensemble machine learning algorithms.

# Description:

All State, a personal insurance company in the United States, is interested in leveraging data science to predict the severity and the cost of insurance claims post an unforeseen event.

# My Approch:

1.	Importing the required libraries and reading the dataset. 

    a.	 Reading the datasets 
    
    b.	 Understanding the dataset

2.	Feature Engineering 

    a.	 Dropping of unwanted columns and values (closed stores)
    
    b.	 Filling Missing Values with Imputation
    
    c.   Data cleaning and Pre-Processing
    
    c.   Outliers Detection and removal

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“

    a.	 Data Visualizatiom

4.	Label Encoding & Feature selection techniques

5.	Model Building 

    a.	 Performing train test split 
    
    b.	 Random Forest Regression Model  
    
    c.   Random Search CV
    
6.	Model Validation 

    a.	 Root mean squared error

7.	Creating the final right model and save the model with best hyperparameters

8.	Deployment using Flask API

9.	Conclusion
